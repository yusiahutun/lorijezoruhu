Then there’s Dicks: The Musical. Originally performed in 2014 in the basement of a Gristedes as a Upright Citizens Brigade show titled Fucking Identical Twins, Dicks was created by and stars Josh Sharp and Aaron Jackson, two of queer comedy’s most illustrious messes. Over the course of Fucking Identical Twins’s original year-and-a-half run, both the show itself and its after-parties became the stuff of legend. While it wasn’t the first gay comedy group to come together — Bob Smith, Danny McWilliams, and Jaffe Cohen performed as the troupe Funny Gay Males in the ’90s — Sharp and Jackson’s show and parties represented a turning point for their generation, a moment when gay comedians could stop seeing one another as competition for the one queer spot on a lineup and start seeing one another as friends and collaborators.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnw4fes400243b7j4p9d0d1c@published data-word-count=222>Now, Sharp and Jackson are attempting to get that party atmosphere into theaters across the country. Produced by A24 (its first musical), Dicks follows two mean, straight businessmen, Craig and Trevor (Sharp and Jackson, respectively), who discover that they are identical twins when they begin work at the same company, where their boss is played by Megan Thee Stallion. They then attempt to Parent Trap their mom and dad, played by Megan Mullally and Nathan Lane. Directed by Larry Charles (<a href=#>Borat</a>) with music written by Karl Johnson and orchestrations by Marius de Vries (<a href=#>La La Land</a>), Dicks is ridiculous, profane, messy as hell, and extremely gay — not only because it stars gay people, but because of its sensibility, which eschews respectability. Mullally, at one point, sings that “My nipples wink, I never sneeze.” There are slimy-looking puppet sewer boys referred to as “gay culture.” And the final song intones, “God is a faggot, and all love is love.” If the film seems designed to provoke anyone with an even slightly conservative streak, well, it wasn’t. “Some of it is naughty and offensive, but that’s just our point of view, and we’re making a movie for us,” Jackson says. “If people are offended, people are offended. I exist anyway. So they can be offended by my art as well if they’d like.”</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnw4fhwg002c3b7j6ke7futw@published data-word-count=6><strong>Spoilers for Dicks: The Musical abound.</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnw4gd7a002w3b7jold4lbpz@published data-word-count=74><strong>What reactions do you want to this film?</strong><br><strong>J.S.: </strong>We only wrote this for the people that will like it.

Most shows you’d pair with another show. Then UCB found that because ours was bombastic and also a musical, nothing could follow it. So after a month of that, they were like, “What about you do the whole hour?” Then as a joke, we’d say, “Join the artists for a post-show talk back at Barracuda,” which was the closest gay bar.

So when there was this one, people took it as this moment to assemble. Now it’s localized in different spaces. We have comedy clubs like the Bell House and Littlefield, and these people are all running shows and doing each other’s shows. There was just less of that then.

We were in our 20s all coming up, wanting to spend a Tuesday night getting drunk at a drag bar. We happened to be the show that ran for long enough that it became a twice-a-month thing. Even UCB sketch nerds would go see it a lot, because it’s just easier to watch that three or four times than just the same sketch.

That’s why he shot a lot in proscenium. He wanted the cinematic version. The stage show was The Parent Trap in half an hour but it wasn’t like, “Let’s stretch The Parent Trap out.” It’s like, “Now The Parent Trap’s in the first 40 minutes and then it should take this left turn and be this other thing.” I didn’t want this to be The Parent Trap in 90 minutes.

When we were writing it originally, we added even more characters than there are now in the movie and stuck to The Parent Trap more. It was still off the fucking walls, but he stripped some away and got even closer to the stage show.

With The Parent Trap, we could play the twins, then we could switch between playing parents.

The show that’s going well could turn bad at any second, and that is so electric. That’s why people love watching Judy Garland.

But then we were like, “It is funny to trick the audience into singing ‘God is a faggot.’” At the stage show, we would shove mics in the audience’s faces only for the word “faggot” to watch how people would react when they’re lost in a crowd singing it.

The central joke of the movie is we don’t look anything alike.” We’re Josh and Aaron. We’ve always said that it’s not a sex scene, it’s a masturbation scene. These guys are selfish assholes — of course the only person they could ever love is their identical twin. When these straight guys get everything they want, they still want more.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnw4gsjx005o3b7j3luoh6ho@published data-word-count=108><strong>I want to talk about bitchiness. Bitchiness is typically a part of the gay comedic voice, but this is a shockingly un-bitchy movie for how faggy it is, no?</strong><br><strong>A.J.: </strong>We like characters that like themselves and the world they inhabit. Gay bitches are usually cynics — they’re commenting, but they’re not involved. They’re back-row kids. These are all front-row kids. They’re very happy to be there. Everyone is all-in, and they’re all like, “I don’t give a shit what you think. I’m doing this because I’m very self-involved.” Of course, Bowen’s character is God, and, as the narrator, he’s the bitchiest, but he’s not involved in the story.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnw4gsjx005q3b7j19355rkc@published data-word-count=20><strong>Even in Bowen’s bitchiness, you’re celebrating him as a bitch.</strong><br><strong>J.S.: </strong>Old Testament God is a bitch.

The title cards say, “This is the first time gay men have ever written anything.” Someone thought that was a dig at Billy Eichner and Bros, and we were like, “No, that was in the UCB show in a pre-show announcement.” Josh and I don’t play in that world very often. We’re nihilistic optimists.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnw4gsjy005t3b7j37n7bzqu@published
