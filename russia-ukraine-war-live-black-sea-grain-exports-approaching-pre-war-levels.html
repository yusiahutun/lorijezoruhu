Reuters could not independently verify the statement but the Kyiv Independent had also reported the news.</p></li><li class=dcr-1lpi6p1><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Russian forces have taken control of <strong>Vesele</strong>, a settlement in Ukraine’s eastern <strong>Donetsk</strong> region, <strong>Russia</strong>’s defence ministry told Reuters on Thursday.

In Ukraine’s first purchase of French-made weapons since the start of the war, Lecornu said <strong>Kyiv</strong> had bought six for €3m-€4m ($3.3m -$4.4m) each.</p></li><li class=dcr-1lpi6p1><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Russian foreign minister, <strong>Sergei Lavrov</strong>, held his annual briefing on Thursday in <strong>Moscow</strong>. In the near three-hour long news conference, he said Russia’s “special military operation” in <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Ukraine</a> had “brought about a certain purification of [Russian] society” and made it “healthier”. He also said Russia “can no longer trust the west”.</p></li><li class=dcr-1lpi6p1><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Ukraine will not decide on conditions to end the conflict as “<strong>Washington</strong> is calling the shots” said <strong>Lavrov</strong> at his annual briefing in Moscow. On the security cooperation agreement recently announced by the <strong>UK</strong> and Ukraine, Lavrov called it a “half-baked product” containing no “legally binding agreements”. He added that not the “slightest interest” has been shown by the <strong>US</strong> and other <strong>western nations</strong> in ending the war.</p></li><li class=dcr-1lpi6p1><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1><strong>Lavrov</strong> claimed the US and other western countries were being surpassed by “emerging and strengthening centres of economic growth, financial power and political influence”, although he was not specific about which countries. Lavrov also said Russia’s relations with <strong>China</strong> were at “their best period in history”.</p></li><li class=dcr-1lpi6p1><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1><strong>Hungarian</strong> prime minister, <strong>Viktor Orbán</strong> called for <strong>EU</strong> support to <strong>Ukraine</strong> to be reviewed annually. Orbán criticised “liberal” politicians for wanting “to give money to Ukraine over four years”, claiming it would be “anti-democratic” to do so just ahead of European parliament elections in June.</p></li><li class=dcr-1lpi6p1><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Orbán’s<strong> </strong>chief of staff, <strong>Gergely Gulyas</strong> said Hungary was in talks with the EU about Ukraine aid but it was not certain an agreement would be reached.
