In 2024, Brady is still quite the top earner, raking in dough from his contract with Fox and myriad commercials.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Brady</a>—the only son of four children from San Mateo, California—played college football at the University of Michigan from 1995 to 1999. After he graduated, Brady was drafted by the <a href=# rel=noopener>New England Patriot</a>s, and played with the team as their star quarterback for 20 seasons from 2000 to early 2020. In March 2020, the day before his contract with the Patriots expired, Brady announced that he would not be resigning his contract with the Boston-based team. Instead, Brady signed with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</a>, with whom he played at the <a href=# rel=noopener>Super Bowl</a> for the first time in February 2021.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lombardi-trophy.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/tom-brady-girlfriend.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$11.73</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$21.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>44% Off</span></p><p>Throughout Brady’s 20-plus-year football career, he’s won the <a href=# rel=noopener>Super Bowl</a> six times and competed in nine games.

He also holds the record for the player who has competed in the most <a href=# rel=noopener>Super Bowls</a>.&nbsp; Tere’s no question that the star quarterback is a household name in the NFL, but what is <a href=# rel=noopener>Tom Brady’s net worth</a> and how much of it consists of his multi-million-dollar salaries and earnings with the Patriots and Buccaneers? Read on for what we know about Tom Brady’s net worth in 2023 and what he made throughout his NFL career.</p><h2>How much did Tom Brady make with the New England Patriots?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tom-Brady-Patriots.jpg><p>How much did Tom Brady make with the New England Patriots? Brady was a quarterback for the New England Patriots from 2000 to 2020. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">NFL Network</a> reported in 2019 that Brady signed a $70 million deal to play with the Patriots for two years. According to the deal, Brady was scheduled to make $30 million in 2020 and $32 million in 2021. A source also told the site that Brady received a raise for his 2019 salary from $15 million to $23 million, which is where the other $8 million came from.</p><p>It’s unclear how much Brady made in the end from the Patriots, as he left the team a year after signing his new contract in March 2020. NFL Insider did note, however, that the contract stated that Brady and the Patriots were “amenable” to adjusting the contract and his salary if necessary. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Business Insider</a>, Brady would’ve made $287.6 million throughout his 20-plus-year football career if he had re-signed with the Patriots in 2020, which is $35 million more than current record holder Eli Manning made in his football career.</p><p>Still, Brady’s last salary with the Patriots was way more than what he made at the start of his NFL career. Business Insider reported that Brady signed a $28 million 2002 to play with the Patriots for four years. When it came time to extend his contract in 2005, Brady, who had three Super Bowl wins under his belt, received a massive raise.</p><h2>How much did Tom Brady make with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tom-Brady-Buccaneers.jpg><p>How much did Tom Brady make with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers? After 20 years with the Patriots, Brady announced in March 2020 that he had signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Pro Football Network</a>, Brady signed a two-year deal with the Buccaneers at the time for $50 million. The site also reports that Brady will receive another $9 million in incentives, though there was no signing bonus. As for how Brady’s contract breaks down, Pro Football Network reports that Brady will earn $15 million salaries for each season, with $10 million roster bonuses. According to the site, Brady’s salary counts for 14.1 percent of the Buccaneers’ salary cap, which is estimated at more than $30 million for 2021.</p><p>Brady announced his first retirement from football in an Instagram post on February 1, 2022. “I’ve done a lot of reflecting this past week and have asked myself difficult questions. And I am so proud of what we have achieved. My teammates, coaches, fellow competitors, and fans deserve 100% of me, but right now, it’s best I leave the field of play to the next generation of dedicated and committed athletes,” he captioned a photo of him playing in the Buccaneers. “This is difficult for me to write, but here it goes: I am not going to make that competitive commitment anymore. I have loved my NFL career, and now it is time to focus my time and energy on other things that require my attention.”</p><p>He also thanked his teammates, coaches and loved ones for their support. “My playing career has been such a thrilling ride, and far beyond my imagination, and full of ups and downs. … I will remember and cherish these memories and re-visit them often. I feel like the luckiest person in the world,” he wrote. He continued, “The future is exciting…[I don’t know] exactly what my days will look like,” and will “take it day by day” but wants to “enrich other people’s lives.”</p><p>Brady’s post also included a message to his wife Gisele Bündchen, and his three children: John, Benjamin and Vivian. “You are my inspiration,” he wrote. “Our family is my greatest achievement. I always came off the field and home to the most loving and supportive wife who has done EVERYTHING for our family to allow me to focus on my career. Her selflessness allowed me to reach new heights professionally, and I am beyond words what you mean to me and our family.”</p><p>A month later, in March 2022, Brady announced on his social media that he had unretired and would return to the Buccaneers. “These past two months I’ve realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands,” Brady wrote at the time. “That time will come. But it’s not now. I love my teammates, and I love my supportive family. They make it all possible. I’m coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa.” Seven months later, in October 2022, Brady and Bündchen announced their divorce.</p><p>In January 2023, Brady announced that his second retirement from football and confirmed he was leaving the sport “for good.” “I’m retiring. For good. I know the process was a pretty big deal last time, so when I woke up this morning I figured I’d just press record, and let you guys know first,” he said. “It won’t be long-winded, you only get one super-emotional retirement essay, and I used mine up last year, so. I…really thank you guys…so much. To every single one of you, for supporting me, my family, my friends, teammates, my competitors. I could go on forever. There’s too many. Thank you guys for allowing me to live my absolute dream. I wouldn’t change a thing. Love you all.”</p><h2>How much was Tom Brady’s Fox Sports contract?</h2><p>How much was Tom Brady’s Fox Sports contract? <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> reported in July 2022 that Brady had signed a 10-year $375 million deal with Fox Sports to be a lead on-air analyst after his retirement from professional football. “They approached me after the season. And there’s a lot of history that I have with Fox,” he told Variety at the time. “I spoke with their executives, and I really had to evaluate if that’s what I wanted to commit to. I have a very unique perspective on football and how it should be played, and what good plays look like and what bad plays look like. I feel like I can still have a great impact on the game. I could stay in the game, doing what I love to do, talking about this incredible sport.”</p><p>Brady explained that Fox Sports approached him after he retired for the first time in February 2022. “Initially, I told them I didn’t want to do it. There was a lot of different emotions. I couldn’t make the decision from the place where I needed to be. For the first time, I was a free agent in life. It’s different than being a free agent in football when one of 31 teams can come after you. I had lots of different people say, ‘You’re free now; we’d love to have you involved in’ — different parts of football, broadcasting, business and finance,” he said. Brady also confirmed to Variety at the time that Fox Sports executives were OK when he unretired from football in March 2022 and that he would start his on-air career “when I’m done playing.” He added, “I’m very close to the end.”&nbsp; Brady confirmed that ESPN also tried to approach him with a deal. “Yeah, at different times. There were a lot of different opportunities I was approached with,” he said.</p><p>As for what kind of broadcaster wanted to be, Brady told Variety, “I’m there to support. I’m there to inform. I have a great knowledge of the game. And I also have very high expectations of what players and coaches should do in the field. I’ll have no problem being critical of things that I disagree with, and I’ll have no problem praising things that are exceptional.”</p><p>Fox Corporation executive chairman and CEO Lachlan Murdoch confirmed Brady’s contract with Fox Sports in a statement in May 2022. “Over the course of this long-term agreement, Tom will not only call our biggest NFL games with Kevin Burkhardt, but will also serve as an ambassador for us, particularly with respect to client and promotional initiatives,” the statement read. “We are delighted that Tom has committed to joining the Fox team and wish him all the best during this upcoming season.”</p><p>In an interview on his “Let’s Go!” podcast before he announced his second retirement in January 2023, Brady confirmed his commitment to Fox Sports. “There’s so much to learn, there’s so much to teach, you know, it’s ever evolving. Believe me, as much as you think I’m willing to teach people, I’m really looking to learn. I’m really looking to learn from all the people that I get to talk to. I get an opportunity to be in a job in the future where I get to travel around and learn from all the other people that I’ve looked up to and admired and different organizations and different people. So it’s exciting for me too. I feel like the opportunity to do that is something that I’m really looking forward to whenever that time comes,” he said.</p><h2>What is Tom Brady’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tom-Brady.jpg><p>The question NFL fans want to know: What is Tom Brady’s net worth? According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Tom Brady’s net worth $250 million, with $30 million earned each year. (His wife, Gisele Bündchen, for her part, is worth worth <a href=# rel=noopener>$400 million</a>, with $40 million each year, according to Celebrity Net Worth.) Of course, most of Brady’s net worth is from his NFL salaries, but a lot of his money also comes from side businesses outside of the NFL. In 2013, Brady launched his own lifestyle brand, TB12. Brady also has his own production company, 199 Productions, which he created in 2020. The company is set to develop documentaries, feature films and TV shows. Brady has also done campaigns for several brands over the years, including Wheaties, UGG, Movado, Smart Water and Tag Heuer, which only adds to his massive net worth. In 2020, Brady also published his first book, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The TB12 Method: How to Do What You Love, Better</a>, which became a New York Times bestseller.</p><h2>What was Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen’s divorce settlement?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-1.jpg><p>What was Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen’s divorce settlement? <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Page Six</a> reported in October 2022 that Brady and Bündchen had hired divorce lawyers after their separation following a fight over Brady’s unretirement from the NFL and his decision to return to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers three months after announcing he was done with football.&nbsp;“I never actually thought this argument would be the end of them, but it looks like it is,” a source told Page Six at the time. “I don’t think there will be any coming back now. They both have lawyers and are looking at what a split will entail, who gets what and what the finances will be.”</p><p>A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> at the time that Brady was “trying to figure out what to do” after he learned Bündchen had hired a divorce lawyer. A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> at the time that Bündchen—who was “living apart” from Brady when she hired her divorce lawyer and had been “at odds” with her husband for months—was waiting for him to make a “big gesture” after he learned her thoughts about divorce were serious. “Gisele is waiting for Tom to make a big gesture of support to her,” the insider said. Gisele filed for divorce from Tom on October 28, 2022, in Florida, which Tom didn’t contest. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> reported at the time that Tom and Gisele reached an agreement on their shared property and child custody. Though the settlement will remain confidential, a source told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> that the couple agreed on joint custody of their children. “The settlement is all worked out,”the insider said. “They’ve been working on the terms this whole time.” The source added, “They agreed to joint custody of the kids.”</p><p>Attorney Sue Moss with Chemtob Moss Forman & Beyda LLP, who is not connected to the couple, also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in October 2022 that Bündchen and Brady’s different incomes could make their divorce complicated.&nbsp;“The big challenge for him is everything will be determined at the height of his income, because to get him to come back, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had to come up with a lot of cash — and that is the baseline for determining the support in this case,” Moss said. “At the beginning, Gisele was earning more than him, and he kept on winning and his income got more and more substantial and it outgrew hers. And because of the timing, the case will be determined based upon the height of earnings.”</p><p>Divorce attorney Jacqueline Newman of Berkman Bottger Newman & Schein LLP, who is also not connected to the couple, also speculated to People that Brady and Bündchen signed a prenuptial agreement because of their high net worths. “People of this magnitude of wealth don’t generally get married without a document that’s going to dictate what’s going to happen if it doesn’t run its course,” Newman said. “My guess is that a lot of this is already worked out. So, there’s probably a prenuptial agreement that’s going to dictate a lot of this, but if there are some properties that were purchased while they were married — marital residences — there may be fights about that.” Newman continued, “There probably were assets that were acquired during the marriage, so there may be squabbles about that to say the least. That said, I think they are going to settle this, assuming they go forward with it — outside of the press.”</p><p>At the time they hired divorce lawyers, Brady and Bündchen owned at least four properties: a house at the Yellowstone Resort in Montana, a $3.5 million apartment in New York City, a home in Costa Rica; and the $17 million mansion tin Miami’s Indian Creek Island. While Brady and Bündchen’s finances are complicated, Newman speculated at the time that custody of their children could be more if an issue. “It really does seem that [Bündchen] has dedicated her life to these children,” Newman said. “I’m sure he is dedicated to the children, but he travels a lot. He’s not involved as much in the day to day. She may want more stability for them.” Newman continued, “The worst thing they could do is pull their kids through a custody battle.”</p><p>Tom and Gisele confirmed their divorce on October 28, 2022, with separate statements on their Instagram Stories. Tom’s statement read: “In recent days, my wife and I finalized our divorce from one another after 13 years of marriage. We arrived at this decision amicably and with gratitude for the time we spent together. We are blessed with beautiful and wonderful children who will continue to be the center of our world in every way. We will continue to work together as parents to always ensure they receive the love and attention they deserve.”</p><p>His statement continued, “We arrived at this decision to end our marriage after much consideration. Doing so is, of course, painful and difficult like it is for many people who go through the same thing every day around the world. However we wish only the best for each other as we pursue whatever new chapters in our lives that are yet to be written. And we kindly ask for privacy and respect as we navigate what is to come in the days and weeks ahead. Thank you.”</p><p>Gisele’s statement read: “With much gratitude for our time together, Tom and I have amicably finalized our divorce. My priority has always been and will continue to be our children whom I love with all my heart. We will continue co-parenting to give them the love, care and attention they greatly deserve.”</p><p>She continued, “The decision to end a marriage is never easy, but we have grown apart and while it is, of course, difficult to go through something like this, I feel blessed for the time we had together and only wish the best or Tom always. I kindly ask that our privacy be respected during this sensitive time. Thank you. Gisele.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-TB-Method-Tom-Brady.jpg><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$11.73</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$21.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>44% Off</span></p><p>For more about Tom Brady, read his book, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The TB12 Method</a>.
