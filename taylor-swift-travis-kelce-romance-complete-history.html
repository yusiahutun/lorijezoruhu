That was pretty ballsy."</h2><p><a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift's</strong></a> fairytale relationship with NFL superstar <a href=#><strong>Travis Kelce</strong></a> has been making headlines for months -- and it all started with a friendship bracelet.</p><p>Back in July 2023, Travis attended Taylor's Eras Tour stop at Arrowhead Stadium and watched her perform on the Kansas City Chiefs' home turf. While he didn't get the chance to meet her after the show, he later revealed that he had intended to slip her his phone number by way of one of the beaded bracelets. Even though they didn't connect at the concert, Taylor still got the message and it wasn't long before dating rumors were swirling.</p><p>Then came a budding romance that dominated the media.</p><p>From dinner dates to football games, from changing lyrics on tour to flying across the other side of the world for the Super Bowl. Anytime the pair were in the same vicinity or one talked about the other -- it became an epic pop culture frenzy online.</p><p>Only time will tell what's in store for Taylor and Travis but here's a complete timeline of what's happened so far…</p><h2 class=h2>JULY 2023: Travis attends Taylor's Eras Tour in Kansas City</h2><p>On July 8th, Travis Kelce stepped out to attend Taylor's Eras Tour at Arrowhead Stadium, the same place where his team, the Kansas City Chiefs, usually play. Travis watched the game from a private box and could be seen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>trading friendship bracelets</strong></a> with other fans inside the venue.</p><h2 class=h2>Travis reveals he tried to give Taylor his number at the show</h2><p>In late July, Travis recounted his experience at Taylor's show during an episode of his podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce</strong></a>. While chatting with his brother, he revealed that he had <a href=#><strong>tried to give Taylor a friendship bracelet</strong></a> with his phone number on it but was disappointed to learn she didn't meet with anyone before or after the show.</p><p>"I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings. So I was a little butthurt that I didn't get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her," Travis said on the podcast. "If you’re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets, and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:c69a4cbc-96aa-4ef1-89d7-d8334f251e05 data-container-ref=toofab:article:00202610-9b36-41fa-90c4-afa65c88115f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/60/5by4/2023/10/05/600c17d064104b6c898bafd34927e301_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">NFL Defends Making Everything About Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce Romance</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Rumors begin swirling that Travis and Taylor are dating</h2><p>By September, rumors had surfaced that Travis and Taylor had met up after his friendship bracelet story went viral. Although there was something going on behind the scenes, Travis' brother <a href=#><strong>Jason said he couldn't comment</strong></a> on the blossoming relationship.</p><p>"I've seen these rumors. I cannot comment," Jason said while appearing on Prime's Thursday Night Football panel. "Ever since Catching Kelce everybody's been infatuated with Travis' love life. I don't really know what's going on there, but I know Travis is having fun and we'll see what happens with whoever he ends up with."</p><h2 class=h2>SEPTEMBER 2023: Travis plays coy about rumors that he's dating Taylor</h2><p>Not long after rumors began swirling, sports media outlets began to joke about the pair's connection. During an NFL Network segment, Rich Eisen <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>made quite a few puns in reference to Taylor</strong></a> and when the clip was uploaded to Instagram, Travis noticed.</p><p>In response, Travis simply wrote, "Well played Rich…. Well played 👏🏻😂."</p><h2 class=h2>Jason jokingly confirms Travis and Taylor's relationship</h2><p>When Travis' brother Jason was asked about the relationship for a second time, he jokingly said that he completely believed all the rumors. While he clarified that he didn't actually know what was going on, fans took his words to heart.</p><p>"It's hard to answer because I don't really know a lot about Travis' love life. I try to keep his business kind of his business, stay out of that world," he said during an appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>DeCamara & Ritchie</strong><strong> on Audacy’s SportsRadio 94 WIP</strong></a>.</p><p>He continued, "Having said that, man, I think they're doing great and I think it’s all 100% true, and I hope this thing goes a mile -- no, I'm joking, I don't know what's happening."</p><h2 class=h2>Travis says he invited Taylor to a Kansas City Chiefs game</h2><p>Towards the end of September, Travis revealed that he had actually invited Taylor to attend a Chiefs game at Arrowhead Stadium, where she had performed her Eras Tour date. At that point, Travis said the ball was "in her court."</p><p>"I threw it out there. I threw the ball in her court and I told her, you know, 'I've seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead, you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one’s a little more lit.'
